<h1><u>Bow Types</u></h1>

<h2>Traditional Bow</h2>
<p>Traditional bows are types of archery equipment that<br>
have been used for centuries. They are distinct from modern compound bows in terms of design,<br>
materials, and the shooting experience.</p>

<h2>Longbow</h2>
<p>The longbow is a traditional type of bow that is characterized by its long length and relatively simple<br>
design. It has been used by various cultures throughout history, most notably by the English during<br>
the Middle Ages. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the longbow, including its history, design, and<br>

<h2>Recurve Bow</h2>
<p>An Olympic recurve bow is a type of bow used in Olympic archery competitions, where athletes<br>
shoot arrows at a target from a distance of 70 meters. The recurve bow is characterized by its curved<br>
limbs that bend away from the archer when unstrung, which gives the bow its name. These bows<br>
are different from traditional longbows and compound bows in terms of design and mechanics.</p>

<h2>Compound Bow</h2>
<p>In modern archery, a compound bow is a bow that uses a levering system,<br>
usually of cables and pulleys, to bend the limbs.[1] The compound bow was first<br>
developed in 1966 by Holless Wilbur Allen in North Kansas City, Missouri, and a<br>
US patent was granted in 1969. Compound bows are widely used in target practice and hunting.</p>
